# ChallengeComicBooks
MVC Project

This was created as part of the C# MVC course at The Tech Academy in which I was provided with a model and tasked with building an MVC application around it which provided master and detail views.

<h3>Master View:</h3>
<img src="" />

<h3>Detail View:</h3>
<img src="" />
